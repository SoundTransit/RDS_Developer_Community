# Sound Transit & Open Transit Data

Sound Transit is leading the region’s effort to gather static (schedules, routes, fares, etc.) and dynamic (real-time and predictive location) transit data and make it accessible to developers and their applications. We work closely with our partner agencies to improve data quality and enhance the scope of what’s offered.
